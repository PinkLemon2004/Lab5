I've been in the shadows
The waters deep yet shallow
But you were there
And everything was beautiful
So precious as can be
Like everybody else
Then I felt you closer
Then it all got better
You took me there
Everything is lovely here
And just maybe I'm?in love
Can I fall in love again?
Maybe you're the one I needed
To take it all away
This pain
Can you fall in love with me?
And tell me that you'll care for me
So when I close my eyes
Will you be there?
To let me know that all will be okay
Can I fall in love again?
This way
With you
Lie...
I think I've been dreaming
Of the never-ending
I know for sure
Maybe this is our part?
Maybe this could be a start?
Can I fall in love again?
Maybe you're the one I needed
To take it all away
This pain
Can you fall in love with me?
And tell me that you'll care for me
So when I close my eyes
Will you be there?
To let me know that all will be okay
Can I fall in love again?
This way
With you
Lie... Lala lie
